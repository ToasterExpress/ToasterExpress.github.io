H&H Comics
----------

-My biggest concerns are these: is there a way to build a better timeline page that can update at the top, and is there a way to quickly import blog posts from another site.

-Import blogs

-Home
-Great Scott! Comics
-Great Scott! Games
-Resources
-News & Events
-About
-Blog
-Patreon

-(optional) store front

Additional notes
----------------
That can be slide 3, and the slide 3 cover can be slide 1

In the corner menu, I think there should be a link to the 
Patreon page right under the Blog page.
