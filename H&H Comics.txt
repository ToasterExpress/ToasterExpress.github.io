H&H Comics
----------

-My biggest concerns are these: is there a way to build a better timeline page that can update at the top, and is there a way to quickly import blog posts from another site.

-Import blogs

-Home
-Great Scott! Comics
-Great Scott! Games
-Resources
-News & Events
-About
-Blog
-Patreon

-(optional) store front

Additional notes
----------------

In the corner menu, I think there should be a link to the 
Patreon page right under the Blog page.

I've been thinking about how to better organize the Great Scott! Comics page.

I'm thinking it should be a split page that links on the left 
to "LEARN ABOUT THE GOLDEN AGE OF COMICS" and the right side 
that says "BUY THE GOLDEN AGE OF COMICS."

Rather, I think it should be two hypertexting images side by side.
Each takes you to separate page where you can read more.
The images could be Funny Picture Stories #5 and #6 side by side.

The description for Cities on the Borderland would 
come from here: https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/445947/Cities-on-the-Borderland-The-Minnesota-Campaign-Sourcebook

Also the Mobster Manual, and its description would 
come from here - https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/414049/Advanced-Hideouts--Hoodlums-Mobster-Manual-Volume-I

Both the comics and games pages could have six sample items to preview and then links to the online stores.
