                <h3>Hideouts & Hoodlums [Basic Rules]
                  2nd Edition</h3>
                <!--            <p>This version of H&H (available in both e-book and print)
                  combines the game of 1977 with the comic books of 1935-1941 to
                  create something both comfortably familiar and startlingly
                  new. The game is still largely compatible with first edition,
                  with additional material like a skill set, a new sample
                  hideout, and a sample metropolis to use as a home base for
                  your heroes. This "basic" book contains everything you need
                  to play a endless standalone sessions, or to run a campaign
                  up through sixth level.</p>
                <p>This edition was thoroughly researched by reading every
                  comic book readily accessible from the years 1935-1939, so
                  as to best emulate the wild and wacky fun of the comics of
                  those times! </p>

                <h3>Supplement V: Big Bang Comics</h3>
                <!--
                <p>The fifth and final supplement for 1st edition was officially
                  endorsed by Gary Carlson and Chris Ecker of Big Bang Comics and
                  was made with their research assistance. It contains new rules
                  for emulating Big Bang Comics, including rules for a time-hopping
                  campaign; new races, mobsters, and trophies culled from the
                  pages of Big Bang Comics; sample stats for the biggest names in
                  the Big Bang Comics universe, and a chronological index of
                  stories from 1938 up into the 1970s. </p>
                <p>While not 100% compatible with second edition, Supplement V
                  is a valuable resource for any fan of Big Bang Comics! (This
                  product is only available as an e-book.)</p>
